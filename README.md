# hello-world
First Repository to explore features of GitHub.

I am a student interested to explore the the abilities of smart phones as well as using large industry scale power systems. An essential feature to explore both of these fields of interest is coding! I am currently enrolled in a course to learn the languages "C" and "Java". The professsor stated the syntaxes are similar but "Java" includes few more functions for objects. I hope to learn what all that means!
